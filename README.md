# Face_Detection_OpenCV_Haarcascade
Face detection algorithm using pre-trained models or OpenCV's Haar Cascades.

# Description
This project demonstrates face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascades. The goal is to detect and locate faces in both static images and real-time video streams. OpenCV provides pre-trained classifiers for face detection that can be easily integrated into various computer vision applications.

# Objective
- Detect faces in images or video streams.
- Utilize OpenCVâ€™s Haar Cascade classifier to identify faces.

# Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language.
OpenCV: For implementing face detection using Haar Cascades.
OpenCV draw rectangle: Draw detection rectangle on detected face.
